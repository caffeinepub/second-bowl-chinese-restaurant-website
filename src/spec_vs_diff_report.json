  "summary": "The diff largely implements cart-style Admin Orders cards and per-item card styling, plus adds supporting Tailwind/CSS utilities and warm primary theming. However, evidence is incomplete/truncated for the Order Details dialog summary block and pill-styled status update controls, and there are extra changes (global theme + project state metadata) not explicitly requested.",
